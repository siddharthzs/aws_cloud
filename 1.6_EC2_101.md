# EC2 101 - Elastic Compute Cloud

# What is EC2?
 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) is just a virtual server(or servers) in the cloud.
 Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

# EC2 Pricing Models

    1) On Demand
        Allows you to pay a fixed reate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment.
        USES:
        Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
        Application with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
        Application being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

    2) Reserved
        Provides you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. Contract Terms are 1 Year or 3 Year Terms.
        USES:
        * Application with steady state or predictable usage
        * Applications that require reserved capacity
        * Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
        
        Pricing TYPES:
            1) Standard Reserved Instances
                These offer up to 75% off on demand instances. The more you pay up front and the longer the contract, the greater the discount.

            2) Convertible Reserved Instance
                These offer up to 54% off on demand capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value.
            
            3) Scheduled Reserved Instances
                These are available to launch within the time windows you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.

    3) Spot Pricing
    Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.

        Applications that have flexible start and end times
        Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
        Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity

    4) Dedicated Hosts
    Physical Ec2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

        Userful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.
        Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
        Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
        Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.


# EBS - What is EBS
    Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. Amzon EBS volumens are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

    TYPES:
        SSD
            Genral Purpose SSD (GP2)
            Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)

        Magnetic
            Throughput Optimized HDD(ST1) - Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive worklaods
            Cold HDD(SC1) - Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads(File Servers).
            Magnetic - Previous Generation

# Exam Tips
    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amzon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

    If the Spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for any hour in which the instance ran.

    Security Groups are virtual firewalls in the cloud. You need to open ports in order to use them. Popular ports are SSH(22), HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), RDP(3389).

    Always Design for failure. Have one EC2 instance in each availability zone.
