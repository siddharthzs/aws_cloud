# S3 Simple Storage Service

### Intro
* S3 is object based storage
* manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks
* Uploads any file type you can think of to s3
It cannot be used to run an operating system or database.

### S3 Basics
* Unlimited Storage
* Objects up to 5 TB in Size
* S3 Buckets, stores file in buckets 
* Universal Namespace for s3 Buckets
* S3 url: https://{bucket-name}.s3.{region}.amazonwas.com/{key-name}
* 200 OK when upload is succesful.
* S3 is a Key - Value Store
* Version ID for storing multiple versions of the same object
* MetaData: Data about the data you are e.g. content-type, last-modified
* S3 is safe and data is spread across multiple deivces in multiple faciities (>= 3 AZs).
* S3 is highly available and highly durable (build for 99.95%-99.99% availabliey)

### S3 Characteristics
* Tiered Storage : S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
* Lifecycle Management: Define rules to automatically transition objects to a cheaper storage tier or delete objects that are no longer required after a set period of time.
* Versioning : With versioning, all versions of an objects are stored and can be retrieved, including dleted objects.

### Secure Your Data
* Server-Side Encryption : set default encryption on an bucket to encypt all new objects when they are stored in the bucket
* Access Control Lists (ACLs) : Define which aws accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. You can attach ACLs to individual objects within a bucket.
* Bucket Policies : S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied 


### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3-IA)
* Rapid Access : accessed less frequently but required rapid access when needed.
* You pay to Access the Data : low per GB storage price and a per GB retrieval fee.
* Great for long-term strage, bakcups, and disaster recorvery files. Minim storage duration : 30 days.

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access 
* Like S3-IA, but data in stored within a single AZ.
* Costs 20% less than reular S3-IA
* Great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data
* Minimum storage duration: 30 days.

### 2 Galcier Options
* Glacier is very cheap storage
* Optimized for data that is very infrequently accessed
* You pay each time you access your data
* Use only for archiving data
-- Glacier
Provides long-term data archiving with retieval times that range from 1 minutes to 12 hr. Historical data only accessed a few times per year. 90 dyas minimum.
-- Glacier Deep Archive
Archives rarely accessed data with in a default retrieval time of 12 hr. financial records that may be accessed once or twice per year. 180 days minimum. 

### S3 - Intelligent Tiering
* when unsure wheather data is frequently used or infrequently
* 2 tiers: frequent and infrequent access
* Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object.

### S3 securing S3 Buckes
* by default, all newly created buckets are private
* by defualt, only the bucket owner can upload new files, read files, delete files, etc.
* No Public Access

### Bucket Policies 
* You can set up access control to your bucket using bucket policies
* Applied at Bucket Policies : policy granted is applied to all the object in the bucket
* Not individual Objects : you can't attach bucket policy to an individual object
* Group of Files : 

### Bucket ACL
* Applied at Object Level, can apply different permission for different objects witin a bucke.
* Grant Access to Objects : we can defiend which account or groups are granted access and also the type of access, e.g., read, write, or full control.
* Fine Grained Control, 

### S3 Access Log
* default : disable
* Logs will be written to another s3 bucket

### S3 Encrption
* Encrption in Transit : encrpt data when sending to and from s3 bucket(SSL/TLS using HTTPS)
