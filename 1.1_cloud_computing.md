# Cloud Computing and AWS
## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, application, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Think of it as simply renting someone elses computer!

## The 6 advantages of cloud computing
    1. Trade Capital expense for variable expense
        instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume

    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
        you will never have the same purchasing power as Amazon. They literally build their own servers!
    
    3. Stop guessing about capacity
        you will probably either buy too much or too little. cloud can scale with your business needs, with no long term contracts
    
    4. Increase speed and agility
        **Serverless architecture** - It scales infinitely with demand.

    5. Stop spending money running and maintaing data centers
        Focus on what you are good at, not at managing infrastructure

    6. Go global in minutes
