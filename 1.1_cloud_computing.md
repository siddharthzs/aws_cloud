# Cloud Computing and AWS
## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, application, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Think of it as simply renting someone elses computer!

## The 6 advantages of cloud computing
    1. Trade Capital expense for variable expense
        instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume

    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
        you will never have the same purchasing power as Amazon. They literally build their own servers!
    
    3. Stop guessing about capacity
        you will probably either buy too much or too little. cloud can scale with your business needs, with no long term contracts
    
    4. Increase speed and agility
        **Serverless architecture** - It scales infinitely with demand.

    5. Stop spending money running and maintaing data centers
        Focus on what you are good at, not at managing infrastructure

    6. Go global in minutes


## 3 Types of Cloud Computing
    1. Infrasturcture As A Service(IAAS)
    2. Platform As A Service(PAAS)
    3. Software As A Service(SAAS)


    IAAS: you manage the server which can be physical or virtual, as well as the operating system. Usually the data centre provider will have no access to your server.  Ex- EC2

    PAAS: Someone else manage the underlying hardware and operating system. You just focus on your applications. Someone else worries about security patching, updates, maintaenance,etc.
    Ex- Go Daddy, Elastic bean

    SAAS: All you manage is your inbox. Cloud provider take care of the data centers, servers, network, storage, maintenance, patching etc. All you worry about is the software itself and how you want to use it.

## 3 Tyeps of Cloud Computing Deployments
    Plubic Cloud = AWS, Azure, GCP
    Hybird = Mixture of public and private
    Private Cloud(on premise) =  You manage it, in your datacenter. Openstack or Vmware


## AWS - High Level Services In Exams
    Compute, Storage, Database, Migration & Transfer, Network & Content Delivery, Security, Identity, Compliance, AWS Cost Management

## What will You Learn In This Course?
    Compute-> EC2, Lambda
    Databases-> Relational Database Service(RDS),DynamoDB (Non Relational Databases)
    Storage-> Simple Storage Service, Glacier
    Network-> VPC, Route53


## Region, Availability Zone, Egde location
    Region : Geographical physical region
    Availability Zone: the data center location
    Edge Locations: endpoints for aws used as cache
