# Cloud Computing and AWS
## What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database, storage, application, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Think of it as simply renting someone elses computer!

## The 6 advantages of cloud computing
    1. Trade Capital expense for variable expense
        instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume

    2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
