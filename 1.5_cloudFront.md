# CloudFront

## What is Cloud Front?
    A content delivery network(CDN) is a system of distributed servers(network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the users, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.

### Edge Location - This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ
### Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balance, or Route53.
### Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.

## TTL(how long a file is cached): Time to Live. The Default TTL is now 89400 seconds (24hr). If the minimum TTL is set to more than 86400 seconds, the Default TTL changes to the value of the Minimum TTL.
