# CloudFront

## What is Cloud Front?
    A content delivery network(CDN) is a system of distributed servers(network) that deliver webpages and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the users, the origin of the webpage, and a content delivery server.

### Edge Location - This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/AZ
### Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balance, or Route53.
### Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations.

## TTL(how long a file is cached): Time to Live. The Default TTL is now 89400 seconds (24hr). If the minimum TTL is set to more than 86400 seconds, the Default TTL changes to the value of the Minimum TTL.

Amazon CloudFront can be used to deliver your entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming, and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. Requests for your content are automatically routed to the nearest edge location, so content is delivered with the best possible performance.


Web Distribution - Typically used for websites
RTMP - used for media streaming

Edge location are not just READ only - you can write to them too.(ie put an object on to them.)
Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (Time To Live.)
You can clear you cached objects, but you will be charged.
